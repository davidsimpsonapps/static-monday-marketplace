It was initially built using 11ty and cursor in under an hour.

The  key features behind the site

- static html with almost no js
- load stupidly fast
- use responsive web design
- be seo optimised
- show what can be achieved in a very short period of time
- Transforming and hosting optimised images for all apps (images are cached for 1 week, so will only be fetched weekly - any chance to an image ca therefore be up to a week behind the proper marketplace)

**Update:** Reviews really slow down the site build, so uncomment the following at the top of `/_data/reviews.js` for quicker development:

```
//   return {};
```

This thing can be changed and updated, but for now it's provided as is.
